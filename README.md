# Web Design Challenge

## Background
This repository took everything I learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard website visualizing the work I did on a previous repository, `https://github.com/doublealogic/api-challenge-python`. In that repository, I used  citipy, a simple Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather across 500+ world cities, which were of varying distance from the Equator.

### Folders Overview
The `assets` folder contains pictures of ten cities that were generated from my temperature search of the 500+ cities.

Within the `Resources` folder, is the csv created out of the above search and holds the data for the above cities.

Last, the `visualizations` folder holds graphs that displayed relationships between various weather aspects and latitude.
